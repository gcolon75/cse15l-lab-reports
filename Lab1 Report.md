# Installing VS Code and Bit Dash
The steps I took in order to download VS code were not much because I had previously installed it.
However if you not installed it visit this [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
and download the appropriate version for your device. Once done is should look similar to the image below.

The next step you will need to do is install git bash on VS code.
Follow this [Link](https://gitforwindows.org) and install git for your device.
Once installed and extracted, in the terminal of VS code there will now be a arrow
where you can access gitBash like the picture below
